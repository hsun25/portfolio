## React frontend
In my first year, I worked on the flagship credit application website for Capital One.
The website was built in React and serviced various Capital One credit cards, including
partnerships. As a engineer, my job was to add in support for new credit cards, which included
various UI updates and calls to the appropriate backend systems.

## Java Spring boot backend and DevOps
I worked on various Java Spring boot backend systems. The first was for customers to apply for credit cards 
at a sales terminal. The second was a way for partners to display selected Capital One information on their partner 
portals. Both applications were in production. I was on a PagerDuty rotation, added new features, and constantly
worked to maintain the application and keep them secure.

## Angular
I worked on the other flagship program for Capital One which is the main website Capital One customers
used to access their accounts, pay their feeds, and various other ways to manage their accounts online.
I worked to add various support for new partnerships to this website. In addition, I also rewrote a key functionality
within the website to display a customer's current rewards balance using a new API.

## iOS mobile
I worked on the main iOS application for Capital One, where customers can see their account balance and manage their accounts
through their phones. As part of this work, I spent roughly a year and half writing mostly in Swift. I added updates to the 
rewards experience on the page customers first see when they logged in. I designed and architected the solution and created 
stories for my teammates to work on.
