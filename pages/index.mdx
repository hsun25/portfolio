Hi there. I'm Holly and I am a Senior Software Engineer with a ravenous appetite for knowledge. I have been working as a software engineer since 2019.
Since then, I have worked on everything from Java Spring Boot backend system deployed in AWS to frontend React and Angular applications. In addition, I
also have mobile experience working on high-traffic features in the company's flagship iOS application. 

I have a passion for improving the existing engineering workflow and stream-lining the development process for future engineers. I believe in improving 
every codebase I work on, in addition to my task. I also enjoy knowledge-sharing and mentoring younger engineers to pursue engineering excellence, creating 
detailed logs and documentation.
